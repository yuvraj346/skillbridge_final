# ✅ UPDATED: Anyone Can Sell Their Skills!

## Changes Made

### 1. Header Navigation Updated
**File**: `templates/components/header.html`

**Before**: Only providers and admins could see "Create Service"
**After**: ALL logged-in users can see "Sell Your Skills"

```html
<!-- Now available to everyone -->
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ url_for('service.create') }}">
    <i class="bi bi-plus-circle me-2"></i>Sell Your Skills
</a></li>
```

### 2. Landing Page Hero Section
**File**: `templates/index.html`

**Added**: Two prominent buttons in hero section:
- "Find Services" - Browse services
- "Sell Your Skills" - Create a service (or register if not logged in)

```html
<div class="d-flex gap-3 justify-content-center mb-5">
    <a href="{{ url_for('service.browse') }}" class="btn btn-outline-light btn-lg">
        Find Services
    </a>
    <a href="{{ url_for('service.create') }}" class="btn btn-gradient-primary btn-lg">
        Sell Your Skills
    </a>
